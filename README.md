# RC_Car
The following project is the Arduino program for the working of an RC_Car.
The RC car moves in two modes.
1. Remote Controlled Mode: The commands are received using an application made in MIT App Inventor which sends the signal to the serial monitor which is picked up by the microcontroller and commands the motors accordingly.
2. Path Finder Mode: The algorithm for the Path-Finder mode are changable and can be modified according to the will of the user.
